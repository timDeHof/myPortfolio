cd portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```

4. Configure EmailJS (see EmailJS Setup section below)

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## EmailJS Setup

To enable the contact form functionality with auto-reply, you'll need to set up EmailJS:

### 1. Create an EmailJS Account

1. Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Create an Email Service

1. In your EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the setup instructions
5. **IMPORTANT**: In the service configuration, make sure to set the "To Email" field to your email address (e.g., `tim@timdehof.dev`) where you want to receive contact form messages
6. Note down your **Service ID**

### 3. Create Email Templates

You'll need to create TWO templates:

#### Main Contact Form Template (for you to receive messages)

1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template structure:

```
Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
Reply to: {{reply_to}}
```

4. Note down your **Template ID**

#### Auto-Reply Template (confirmation for users)

1. Create another new template
2. Use this auto-reply template structure:

```
Subject: Thank you for contacting Tim DeHof

Hi {{to_name}},

Thank you for reaching out! I've received your message and will get back to you within 24 hours.

Here's a copy of your message:
"{{original_message}}"

Best regards,
Tim DeHof
Full-Stack Developer

For urgent matters, you can reach me directly at tim@timdehof.dev
```

**Important Settings for Auto-Reply Template:**
- Set "To Email" field to: `{{to_email}}`
- Set "From Name" to: `Tim DeHof`
- Set "From Email" to your email address (e.g., `tim@timdehof.dev`)

5. Note down your **Auto-Reply Template ID**

### 4. Get Your Public Key

1. Go to "Account" in your dashboard
2. Find your **Public Key** in the API Keys section

### 5. Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_main_template_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_AUTO_REPLY_TEMPLATE_ID=your_auto_reply_template_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

### 6. Verify Email Service Configuration

**CRITICAL**: Make sure your EmailJS service has a recipient email configured:

1. Go back to "Email Services" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Click on your service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Ensure the "To Email" field is filled with your email address (e.g., `tim@timdehof.dev`)
4. Save the configuration

Without a properly configured recipient email in the service settings, you'll get a "recipients address is empty" error.

### Auto-Reply Features

When properly configured, the contact form will:

1. Send you the original message from the user
2. Automatically send a confirmation email to the user with:
   - A thank you message
   - Confirmation that you'll respond within 24 hours
   - A copy of their original message
   - Your contact information

The auto-reply is optional - if you don't configure the `VITE_EMAILJS_AUTO_REPLY_TEMPLATE_ID`, the system will still work but won't send confirmation emails to users.
